<!-- A static blog theme based on [Astro](https://astro.build), designed for clarity and focus.

With a deliberately minimal design, this layout ensures your content takes center stage. It's built for flexibility, offering customization options that honor its clean and elegant aesthetic.

Effortlessly share your thoughts in _a calm & dustless space._

I hope this website serves as a sort of time capsule, preserving my thoughts long after I’m gone. Sure, this is just another blog in a sea of many, but it’s not only for others, it’s also for me, and for my future self.
