## Introduction

Hi, I’m Malshan a.k.a CeyloneBite ([CeyloneBite](https://github.com/ezpzk) on GitHub). I finally decided to create my own personal website. This site will be my primary space to share ideas, thoughts and showcase my work. I’ve always disliked platforms like Instagram and Facebook, but I still have profiles there because yeah I like to waste my time by watching reels.

The thoughts I share here are mine and not AI-generated, because I want this website to reflect *who I am*, not what I want others to *think* I am. I’ll try to write regularly, but I’m not the type of person to follow strict schedules. So, forgive me if I take breaks when inspiration doesn’t strike, and I'm trying my best to write in English.

## Why Bother with All This?

Writing is an important skill, and though I’m usually reserved with my opinions, this is one area I feel strongly about. Unfortunately, I haven't written much since joining college, and I aim to change that. Humans are among the few species who can use tools, and we’re the only ones who *encode* our thoughts onto external objects, allowing those thoughts to persist beyond our lifetimes.

I hope this website serves as a sort of time capsule, preserving my thoughts long after I’m gone. Sure, this is just another blog in a sea of many, but it’s not only for others, it’s also for me, and for my future self.

## About This Website

You’ll notice this website is simple, minimal, and doesn’t feature a lot of the flashy animations you typically see in portfolio & blog sites. That’s because I wanted it to be a true representation of who I am, minimal and functional. I don’t like bloat, and my workflows and environments are often pared down to the essentials. That said, aesthetics matter too, as we often *see* before we *read*. I think this website looks good *despite* being minimal.

<!-- As plagiarism is bad (I’m sure [hbomberguy](https://youtu.be/yDp3cB5fHXQ?si=ylsRkmRivSJdJ32L) would agree), I’d like to give credit where it’s due:

- Astro Web Framework
- astro-erudite Template
- JetBrains Mono Font (my beloved)
- The logo is Napstablook from *Undertale* :) -->

<!-- Everything I program and create (including this site) is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/ezpzk) and I hope to continue that trend as much as reasonably possible. -->
